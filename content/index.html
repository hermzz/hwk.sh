My name is Hermann KÃ¤ser and this is my website. I currently work as a freelance programmer in London, United Kingdom.

You can find me elsewhere:

* tumblr
* flickr
* github
* last.fm
* facebook
* delicious
* google code
* masterbranch

If you need hosting for a noble cause let me know. Mainly PHP, Python, and MySQL, but if you require something else I'm sure we can arrange something. The road is long and I've got bandwidth to burn.

If you're an australian IT company who is looking to import some talent, check out my CV.

Also hosted on this server are the following sites:
