If you need hosting for a noble cause [let me know](mailto:hermann.kaser@gmail.com). Mainly PHP, Python, and MySQL, but if you require something else I'm sure we can arrange something. The road is long and I've got bandwidth to burn.

If you're an australian IT company who is looking to import some talent, check out my CV.
