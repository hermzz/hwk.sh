Technical Abilities
-------------------

Linux
: I know Linux like the palm of my hand, I've been administrating servers since 2002 and started using it for all my personal computers even earlier. I've tried and used almost all popular distributions under the sun: Slackware, Gentoo, Debian, CentOS, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Arch, etc...

PHP
: I have been programming in PHP since 2002. I've written Content Managment Systems, E-commerce sites, image galeries, calendars, and more.

Python
: My programming language of choice since I started using it mid 2007. Semicir.cl, Commie Comics, and palabro.es are written in Python using the [web.py](http://webpy.org/) framework.

SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
: Most of the work I've done runs of MySQL databases, but I've used PostgreSQL for some projects. I have worked on projects with 28,000,000+ rows, 200+ multigigabyte tables.

SVN, Git
: I'm a heavy user of VCS's for both work and personal projects. I've used both SVN and Git for professional and personal projects.

X/HTML, CSS
: All the work I've done recently is mostly done in valid XHTML, properly separating content from appearance with the use of CSS.

JavaScript
: Good knowledge of AJAX and when to use it, I always try to provide alternatives for JavaScript challenged browsers. My library of choice is jQuery, but I've also used mootools and prototype.

C#, .NET
: Studied at university, some GUI and console work.

Bash
: Occasional bash scripts for automation and general maintenance of Linux startup scripts.

### More about me

I'm an old school science fiction fan (Asimov, Bradbury, Philip K. Dick) but I'll read almost any kind of fiction I can get my hands on. I enjoy a good game of [Ultimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_%28sport%29). I started playing while at university and I've continued ever since playing for a number of club teams from different countries and representing Spain at European and World level competitions. I also like to take [pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/hermzz/) and I maintain [a tumblr blog](http://blog.volt.io/).
