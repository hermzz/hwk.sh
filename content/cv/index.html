### More about me

I'm an old school science fiction fan (Asimov, Bradbury, Philip K. Dick) but I'll read almost any kind of fiction I can
get my hands on. I enjoy a good game of [Ultimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_%28sport%29). I started
playing while at university and I've continued ever since playing for a number of club teams from different countries
and representing Spain and Great Britain at European and World level competitions. I spend summers either cycling or
sailing and winters cross-country skiing. As a recent arrival to Montréal, I've been learning French and have managed to
get it to a conversational level and I'm keen to keep learning!
